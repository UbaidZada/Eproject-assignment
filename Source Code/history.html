            August 1833, the eruption of the main island of Krakota(or Krakatau) killed more than 36,000 people, making

            The volcanic island known as Krakatoa is located is the Sunda Strait, between the island of java and
            Sumatra. At the time of its famous eruption in 1883, the region was part of the Dutch East indies; it's now
            part of indonesia.
            <br><br>A previous major eruption, likely in the fifth or sixth century A.D is thought to have created
            Krakatoa and two nearby islands, Lang and Verlatan, as well as the undersea caldera (volcanic crater)
            between
            them.
            By 1833, Krakatoa was made up of three peaks: Perboewatan, the northermost and most active; Danan in the
            middle;
            and the largest, Rakata, which formed the southern end of the island.
